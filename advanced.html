    <h2>Lakes</h2>
<p>
    Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing glaciation. 
    Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers, where a river channel 
    has widened into a basin. Some parts of the world have many lakes formed by the chaotic drainage patterns 
    left over from the last Ice Age. All lakesare temporary over long periods of time, as they will slowly fill
    in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

    Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for industrial or agricultural use, for hydro-electric power 
    generation or domestic water supply, for aesthetic or recreational purposes, or for other activities.
