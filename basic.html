    <h1>Birds</h1>
    <p>
        Birds (Aves) are a group of animals with backbones which evolved from dinosaurs. Technically speaking, they are dinosaurs.[2]

        Birds are endothermic. The heat loss from their bodies is slowed down by their feathers. Modern birds are 
        toothless: they have beaked jaws. They lay hard-shelled eggs. They have a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered 
        heart and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.

        Birds live all over the world. They range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.70 m (9 ft) ostrich. 
        They are the tetrapods with the most living species: about ten thousand. More than half of these are passerines, sometimes 
        known as perching birds.
